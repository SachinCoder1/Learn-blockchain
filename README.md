## Basics of blockchain

 ###### 1. What is Blockchain
     Blockchain is distributed immutable ledger where:
 
     1. Distributed means the blockchain is distributed all over the network.
     2. Immutable means the data once stored it can't be changed or deleted. **Main benefit of blockchain**
     3. Ledger means a place where transactions are stored in a block of a blockchain.
    
    
 ###### 2. What is Ethereum
     Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.
     
 ###### 3. What is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and why do we use it.
     EVM is used to create virtual machine inside computer or node.  We use it to secure the network.

 ###### 4. What is Smart Contracts
     Smart contract is nothing but a program that runs on blockchain.
     
     In easy language, smart contract is an agreement between two people. 
     
     
 ###### 5. What is DAPP (Decentralized application)
     DAPP is a decentralized application which runs on decentralized network. 
 
     1. Some examples of decentralized examples are: d.tube which is decentralized version of youtube. presearch which is decentralized version of google. Same for twitter we have lbry.
     2. Decentralized means that there is no central authority or person who can control it. 
     3. To Make DAPP we need smart contract and frontend. 
     
     
 ###### 6. Difference between centralized apps and decentralized apps.
     DAPP is a decentralized application which runs on decentralized network. 
     
     Centralized apps :-
     
     1. These types of apps can go down. 
     2. We can't trust them because we don't know how they use our data.
     
     Decentralized apps :-
     
     1. These types of apps are never down because it is available everywhere.
     2. We can trust DAPPs because most of applications are open source.
