 ###### 1. What is Blockchain
     Blockchain is distributed immutable ledger where:
 
     1. Distributed means the blockchain is distributed all over the network.
     2. Immutable means the data once stored it can't be changed or deleted. **Main benefit of blockchain**
     3. Ledger means a place where transactions are stored in a block of a blockchain.

 ###### 3. What is Smart Contracts
     Smart contract is nothing but a program that runs on blockchain.
     In easy language, smart contract is an agreement between two people. 
     
     
 ###### 4. What is DAPP (Decentralized application)
     DAPP is a decentralized application which runs on decentralized network. 
 
     1. Some examples of decentralized examples are: d.tube which is decentralized version of youtube. presearch which is decentralized version of google. Same for twitter we have lbry.
     2. Decentralized means that there is no central authority or person who can control it. 
     3. To Make DAPP we need smart contract and frontend.
